--> Problem Statement:
Yulu, a leading micro-mobility service provider in India, is experiencing a decline in revenue and seeks to understand the factors affecting the demand for its shared electric cycles. The objective is to identify significant variables that influence demand and determine how well these variables explain the market trends. By analyzing these factors, Yulu aims to optimize its operations and boost demand for its shared electric cycles across different locations in the Indian market.

--> Insights from hypothesis testing:
Seasonality Effect: There is a significant difference in bike demand across seasons, with higher rentals during summer and fall, indicating seasonality as a major driver of demand.
Weather Impact: Weather conditions significantly influence demand. Clear and sunny days see higher bike usage, whereas rainy or foggy weather reduces demand.
Weekend vs. Weekday Demand: The analysis shows no significant difference in bike demand between weekdays and weekends, suggesting consistent usage across the week.
Registered vs Casual Riders: Registered riders contribute significantly to overall rentals, with casual users showing more variation based on weather and other external factors.
--> Recommendations:
Seasonal Promotions: Yulu should focus on targeted promotions during peak seasons like summer and fall to maximize rentals. Offering discounts or loyalty programs during off-peak seasons (winter) could help maintain demand.
Weather-Responsive Pricing: Introduce dynamic pricing based on weather conditions. Lowering prices during rainy or foggy days can help maintain usage during unfavorable weather.
Improve User Retention: Since registered riders contribute heavily to total rentals, Yulu should focus on retention strategies such as personalized offers, subscriptions, and rewards to increase long-term user engagement.
